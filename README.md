# 🎸 GuitarLA: A React-based Guitar Store 🎸

GuitarLA is an educational project based in our previous project [GuitarLA](https://github.com/EFZR/guitarLA) with the only difference that this project is built using Typescript and React.

Some of the cool things of this project, is that we are able to use the power of the React hook being able to use: `useReducer` and `useContext` to manage the state of the application making the code more maintainable.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the application.
- **Typescript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
